# Computer-Aided Die Study (CADS)
This project is a work-in-progress for my undergraduate thesis at Trinity University, in collaboration with the American Numismatic Society.

## Building
A pre-compiled version of `opencv.js` is included out-of-the-box, but you can use `dev/build_opencvjs_linux.sh` to compile it yourself on a linux machine. It will install the necessary toolchain. Be sure to have Python 2.7.x installed before running.

## Running
To run the application from source, simply `npm install` to get the dependencies, then `npm start`. This will bring up an Electron window.
